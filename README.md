## Attribution

This project was made following the excellent tutorial by [Anthony GG](https://www.youtube.com/@anthonygg_) on YouTube. The [first of the videos in this series can be found here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwZuNmAzaH8). Anthony GG created this project, and I simply followed along.

In the process, I learned a lot and continue to learn a lot from working through example projects like this one! I really appreciate Anthony's explanations, and I highly recommend you check out his YouTube channel and his [GitHub profile](https://github.com/anthdm) as well!
