This project was made following the excellent tutorial by [Anthony GG](https://www.youtube.com/@anthonygg_) on YouTube. His [video can be found here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwZuNmAzaH8). He created this project, I just followed along, but in the process, I learned a lot! So, I really appreciate his tutorial, and I recommend you check it out as well!
